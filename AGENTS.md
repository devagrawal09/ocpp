- After changing the public Protocol or Server `HttpApi`, run `bun run generate` from `packages/client`. Do not edit generated client files directly.
- Keep runtime dependencies directed from Schema to Core and Protocol, then from Core and Protocol to Server. Client runtime code may depend on Schema and Protocol but never Core or Server; `sdk` composes Client, Core, and Server.
- Current implementation changes belong in `packages/core`, `packages/cli`, `packages/server`, `packages/protocol`, `packages/schema`, and related generated client surfaces when required.
- This repository does not use Changesets. Do not add `.changeset` files; follow the existing release workflow instead.
- The default branch in this repo is `v2`.
- Base all new branches and worktrees on `v2`, or `origin/v2` when the local `v2` ref is unavailable. Do not base them on `dev`.
- Local `main` ref may not exist; use `v2` or `origin/v2` for diffs.

## Branch Names

Use a short branch name of at most three words, separated by hyphens. Do not use slashes or type prefixes such as `feat/` or `fix/`.

Examples: `session-recovery`, `fix-scroll-state`, `regenerate-sdk`.

## Commits and PR Titles

Use conventional commit-style messages and PR titles: `type(scope): summary`.

Valid types are `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, and `test`. Scopes are optional; use the affected package or area when helpful, e.g. `core`, `ocpp`, `cli`, `app`, `sdk`, or `plugin`.

Examples: `fix(app): simplify thinking toggle styling`, `docs: update contributing guide`, `chore(sdk): regenerate types`.

## Style Guide

### General Principles

- Keep things in one function unless composable or reusable
- Do not extract single-use helpers preemptively. Inline the logic at the call site unless the helper is reused, hides a genuinely complex boundary, or has a clear independent name that improves the caller.
- Before adding complexity for a speculative or vanishingly unlikely race or security edge case, explain the concrete failure mode, likelihood, and complexity cost to the user and get their buy-in. Do not silently expand scope for theoretical robustness.
- Avoid `try`/`catch` where possible
- Avoid using the `any` type
- Use Bun APIs when possible, like `Bun.file()`
- Rely on type inference when possible; avoid explicit type annotations or interfaces unless necessary for exports or clarity
- Prefer functional array methods (flatMap, filter, map) over for loops; use type guards on filter to maintain type inference downstream
- In `src/config`, follow the existing self-export pattern at the top of the file (for example `export * as ConfigAgent from "./agent"`) when adding a new config module.
- In Effect generators, bind services to named variables before calling methods. Do not use nested service yields such as `yield* (yield* Foo.Service).bar()`.

Reduce total variable count by inlining when a value is only used once.

```ts
// Good
const journal = await Bun.file(path.join(dir, "journal.json")).json()

// Bad
const journalPath = path.join(dir, "journal.json")
const journal = await Bun.file(journalPath).json()
```

### Destructuring

Avoid unnecessary destructuring. Use dot notation to preserve context.

```ts
// Good
obj.a
obj.b

// Bad
const { a, b } = obj
```

### Imports

- Never alias imports. Do not use `import { foo as bar } from "..."` or renamed imports like `resolve as pathResolve`.
- Never use type-position `import("...")` references such as `Schema.declare<import("@ocpp/plugin/effect/plugin").Plugin["effect"]>`. Only when two imports genuinely collide on a name and no other option exists, an aliased type import (`import type { Plugin as PluginDefinition } from "..."`) is permitted as a last resort — still strongly preferred not to.
- Never use star imports. Do not use `import * as Foo from "..."` or `import type * as Foo from "..."`.
- If a namespace-style value is needed, import the module's own exported namespace by name, for example `import { Project } from "@ocpp/core/project"`, then reference `Project.ID`.
- Prefer dynamic imports for heavy modules that are only needed in selected code paths, especially in startup-sensitive entrypoints. Destructure dynamic import bindings near the top of the narrowest scope that needs them so they read like normal imports. Avoid inline chains such as `await import("./module").then((mod) => mod.value())` or `(await import("./module")).value()`. Keep branch-specific imports inside the branch that needs them to preserve lazy loading.

### Variables

Prefer `const` over `let`. Use ternaries or early returns instead of reassignment.

```ts
// Good
const foo = condition ? 1 : 2

// Bad
let foo
if (condition) foo = 1
else foo = 2
```

### Control Flow

Avoid `else` statements. Prefer early returns.

```ts
// Good
function foo() {
  if (condition) return 1
  return 2
}

// Bad
function foo() {
  if (condition) return 1
  else return 2
}
```

### Complex Logic

When a function has several validation branches or supporting details, make the main function read as the happy path and move supporting details into small helpers below it.

```ts
// Good
export function loadThing(input: unknown) {
  const config = requireConfig(input)
  const metadata = readMetadata(input)
  return createThing({ config, metadata })
}

function requireConfig(input: unknown) {
  ...
}
```

- Keep helpers close to the code they support, below the main export when that improves readability.
- Do not over-abstract simple expressions into many single-use helpers; extract only when it names a real concept like `requireConfig` or `readMetadata`.
- Do not return `Effect` from helpers unless they actually perform effectful work. Synchronous parsing, validation, and option building should stay synchronous.
- Prefer Effect schema helpers such as `Schema.UnknownFromJsonString` and `Schema.decodeUnknownOption` over manual `JSON.parse` wrapped in `Effect.try` when parsing untrusted JSON strings.
- Add comments for non-obvious constraints and surprising behavior, not for obvious assignments or control flow.

### Schema Definitions (Drizzle)

Use snake_case for field names so column names don't need to be redefined as strings.

```ts
// Good
const table = sqliteTable("session", {
  id: text().primaryKey(),
  project_id: text().notNull(),
  created_at: integer().notNull(),
})

// Bad
const table = sqliteTable("session", {
  id: text("id").primaryKey(),
  projectID: text("project_id").notNull(),
  createdAt: integer("created_at").notNull(),
})
```

## Testing

- Avoid mocks as much as possible, you shouldn't be using globalThis.\* at all unless it's the only option.
- Test actual implementation, do not duplicate logic into tests
- Tests cannot run from repo root (guard: `do-not-run-tests-from-root`); run from package directories such as `packages/core`.

## Type Checking

- Always run `bun typecheck` from package directories (for example, `packages/core`), never `tsc` directly.

## V2 Session Core

- Keep durable events minimal: record irreducible new facts and do not repeat state derivable by folding the ordered aggregate history. Enrich projections and read models with previous or derived state when consumers need self-contained views.
- Keep durable prompt admission separate from model execution. `Session.prompt(...)` publishes `session-inbox-enqueued`, whose projection inserts one durable `session_inbox` row, before scheduling advisory `SessionExecution.wake(sessionID)` unless `resume: false` requests admit-only behavior. Delivery publishes `session-inbox-delivered`; its projection consumes the inbox row and inserts the visible message in the same transaction. `session_inbox` stores only unconsumed work.
- Reusing a Session ID adopts the existing Session. Reusing a user or synthetic inbox item ID is idempotent when Session and type match: the first admission wins and the retried payload, metadata, and delivery mode are ignored, whether the item is still pending or already delivered (reconciled from the projected message without retained enqueue history). Cross-Session or cross-type reuse fails. Control items keep their operation-specific conflict behavior.
- Keep `SessionExecution` process-global and Session-ID based. Its local implementation owns the process-local Session coordinator and discovers placement through `SessionStore` plus `LocationServiceMap.get(session.location)` only when a drain starts; no layer should take a Session ID. V2 interruption targets the active process-local ownership chain for that Session; interruption of a known but idle or locally unowned Session is a no-op, while the public API rejects an unknown Session.
- Keep `SessionRunner`, model resolution, tool registry, tool lists, and filesystem Location-scoped. Omitted `Location.workspaceID` means implicit-local placement; explicit workspace identity remains reserved for future placement semantics.
- Preserve one explicit `llm.stream(request)` call per Physical Attempt and reload projected history before durable continuation. A logical Step may use generic pre-output retries, one full-context retry after continuation rejection, incomplete-stream continuation, or one overflow-compaction rebuild. Generic retries retain the logical step number and do not consume another agent-step allowance. Do not delegate orchestration to an in-memory tool loop.
- Keep local Session drains process-local until clustering is implemented. The embedded session runtime joins explicit same-Session resumes, coalesces wakes recorded before an execution starts, and runs different Sessions concurrently, one outboxed step job per Session at a time. An execution recorded as started without a `session-execution-settled` marks a busy period for restart recovery: success, failure, or user interruption settles it, while shutdown and process death leave it running. On startup the runtime resumes those executions from its log within its per-step retry budget and appends a durable continuation instruction. That unsettled execution is a recovery marker, not clustered ownership, fencing, or an exactly-once guarantee.
- Keep delivery vocabulary explicit. Prompts steer by default. Steers deliver in enqueue order at safe step boundaries, stopping before compaction or move control items. At an idle boundary, steers take priority; otherwise exactly one queued item delivers before the runner reevaluates continuation. Inbox items may be cancelled or changed between queue and steer before delivery. Promoting new user input resets the selected agent's step allowance; a batch of steers resets it once.
- One step is one logical LLM call; its durable record covers only the model-visible span. Do not write "provider turn", and do not use bare "turn" for a single call: "turn" is reserved for the future assistant-turn unit containing all steps from prompt promotion until the session would go idle.
- Keep event replay ownership separate from clustered Session execution ownership.
- Keep the Instructions algebra and built-ins in `src/instructions`; keep instruction producers with their observed domains, and keep Session History selection plus `InstructionState` and `InstructionEntry` persistence Session-owned. `InstructionDiscovery` observes ambient global and upward-project instructions. The runner composes built-ins, discovery, guidance, and entries explicitly in `loadInstructions`; there is no instruction registry.
- `session-instructions-updated` stores changed source keys and content hashes and may freeze rendered chronological update text. Blob values live once in `instruction_blob`; the projected `instruction_state` row is the normal boundary-processing source of current and initial values. Request assembly renders the epoch baseline from stored values, while later frozen updates enter history as durable System messages. Completed compaction moves the instruction epoch; Session movement retains it so destination instruction changes are chronological, while committed revert clears it. Forks adopt the parent's newest instruction values even when copied message history ends at an earlier boundary. Unavailable sources retain the last value and block only the initial complete delta.

<!-- BEGIN AWS Agent Toolkit rules -->

## AWS Agent Toolkit

Use AWS CLI profile `devagr`. The project's selected Region is `us-east-2`; use `us-east-1` only for the Agent Toolkit service.

# AWS Guidance for the new AWS experience

This user has signed up for the new AWS experience. This experience lets you sign into AWS using a social provider and requires the following additional context.

Where this guidance conflicts with the project's own instructions, the project's instructions take precedence.

## Context

### Terminology:

- Say "project" instead of "account" — a project contains an AWS account and settings for sharing with other collaborators
- Say "team member" instead of "IAM user" — users are invited by email, not created or federated in IAM
- Say "AWS Settings" when referring to management tasks at [settings.aws.com](https://settings.aws.com/) (project management, billing, team members, spend limits). Users view their actual AWS resources in the AWS Management Console.
- Say "selected Region" when referring to the user's Region — not "home Region"
- The user has a managed IAM experience. This includes a managed service control policies (SCP) and resource control policies (RCP) that govern the use of AWS. They will still need to use IAM to create policies to let services work with each other. If there are questions about the SCPs or RCPs, go to the documentation at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/scps-and-rcps-for-projects.html

### Constraints:

- All projects share a single AWS Region determined by the user's contact address. Resources cannot be created in other Regions
- When developing:
  - MUST create all Regional resources in the project's assigned Region
  - You CAN create AWS WAF and Cloudwatch Logs resources in us-east-1 when there are global resources (like a global WAF instance) that require a connection to dependencies in us-east-1. You should not use these for any other reason, because resources in the selected Region will provide lower cost (due to no cross-Region traffic), increased availability (due to no cross-Region traffic), and easier manageability (due to not needing to look in another Region). When you need to do an inventory of resources, you need to look in both the selected Region and us-east-1 for Cloudwatch Logs or WAF resources.
  - MUST NOT attempt to create Lambda, API Gateway, or other Regional resources in any other Region
  - MUST direct users to confirm their Region in AWS Settings > View all projects > Overview > Additional Info > Region. If the user cannot confirm their Region, check in ~/.aws/config
  - MUST NOT use Lambda@Edge — excluded from both Lambda and CloudFront
  - MUST NOT use CloudFormation StackSets — no multi-account or multi-Region deployments
  - MUST NOT attempt cross-Region actions — no cross-Region replication for DynamoDB/S3/RDS, no multi-Region KMS keys
  - MUST NOT use Route 53 cross-Region routing — geolocation, latency-based, and failover routing policies are not available
  - CloudFront is a global service and its actions ARE allowed in `us-east-1`. A user can create a CloudFront distribution pointing to their project-region Lambda function URL or API Gateway. However, Lambda and API Gateway themselves MUST NOT be created in `us-east-1` — they must be in the project Region.
  - Reduced availability in `eu-north-1` specifically: Amazon Rekognition, Amazon Textract, Amazon Personalize, AWS App Runner are not available in that Region.
- IAM permissions for human access are managed by AWS. Don't assign roles to team members unless absolutely necessary
- The user may have a spend limit if they are on the paid plan. The limit that pauses their project if it's exceeded. If resources suddenly become inaccessible, ask if they have a spend limit configured. Only project owners can modify a spend limit.
- When developing:
  - MUST ask about spend limit status if the user reports sudden "Access Denied" errors on operations that previously worked
  - MUST direct users to check spend status in AWS Settings > Billing
  - MUST check if a user has upgraded their account to the paid plan
  - MUST ask the user if they want to clean up the successfully created resources or keep them to reduce cost
- The user sets up billing, creates spend limits, and retrieves and pays invoices in AWS Settings. The user creates budgets and optimizes their costs in the AWS Billing and Cost Management console
- Not all AWS services are available. If a service isn't working, do the following:
  1. Run the command `aws freetier get-account-plan-state`
  2. If accountPlanType": "FREE", check the [Free Tier supported services list](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/supported-services-sign-up-new.html#supported-services-free-tier) next,
  3. If accountPlanType": "PAID", check the [Paid Tier supported services list](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/supported-services-sign-up-new.html#supported-services-paid-plan).
  4. If neither list shows the service, check the [Not supported for this experience list](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/accounts/latest/reference/supported-services-sign-up-new.html#unsupported-services). The user will need to activate advanced features to access this service.
- Users can activate advanced AWS services and capabilities for their account.
- Before starting a task, check whether a relevant AWS skill is available. Load the skill with retrieve_skill and prefer its guidance over general knowledge.

### Help level

- help_level (required): LOW, MEDIUM, or HIGH. While a user is building, you MUST ask the user: "How much guidance would you like from me? Low (I only flag security risks), medium (I ask a couple of clarifying questions if something seems off), or high (I explain what I'm doing, suggest alternatives, and flag best practices)."

You CAN update this rule file to save a user's help_level.

Constraints for each level:

**LOW:**

- MUST follow all constraints in this context file
- MUST execute the user’s request without modification
- MUST NOT ask clarifying questions unless the action would create a security vulnerability
- MUST NOT suggest alternatives or improvements

**MEDIUM:**

- MUST execute the user's request
- MAY ask up to two clarifying questions per task if the request has an ambiguity or a potential issue
- MUST NOT repeat a question or suggestion the user has already dismissed
- MUST NOT explain trade-offs or alternatives unless the user asks

**HIGH:**

- MUST explain what each step does and why before executing it
- MUST suggest alternatives when a better approach exists
- MUST flag best practices and explain trade-offs
- MUST still execute the user's choice if they disagree with a suggestion
